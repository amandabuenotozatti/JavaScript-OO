## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

> #### Objective
> How to organize software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
> </br>
> Object-oriented programming has four basic concepts: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### First Class and Objects 
- Creating classes
- What are attributes
- Instance/Object
- New operator

### Adding Behaviors
- Method creation
- Keyword "this"
- Encapsulation
- Private attribute proposal
- Return and early return

### Modular Programming
- Package.json
- Modules import/export
- What are the advantages of having code where we use classes and composition instead of primitive types
- Value types and reference types
- Dynamically changing an object

### Accessing Private Attributes
- Differences between null and undefined
- Deepening the concepts of references to a memory space
- Getters and Setters
- Best-in-class encapsulation
- Protecting sensitive attributes

### Constructors and static attributes
- Builders
- Encapsulation
- "Readonly" attributes
- Static attributes
